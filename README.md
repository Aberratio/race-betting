Rules: 
1. Places and participants can be bet as you wish. If a new place or a participants conflicts with a previous selection, the previous one is overwritten with the new changes. 
2. New selections are saved in the application memory only after the save button is pressed. 
3. The reset button clears only the visual layer - to keep the changes (cleared bet) you have to press "SAVE CHANGES". 
4. The save button is active when:
    a. all fields filled in (correctly!),
    b. all fields are empty and the previous state of the application contained a bet for that race.
5. The reset button is active whenever at least one race field is filled in. 

Notes: 
The application stores data in local storage.

Enjoy :)
